          TRY_TO_TIMESTAMP function, which attempts to convert the
          'created_date' string into a timestamp using the provided formats
          ('yyyy-mm-ddthh24:mi:ss.ff3z' and 'yyyy-mm-ddthh24:mi:ssz'). If the

        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
  - name: s_invoice_dates_mapping
    description: The s_invoice_dates_mapping model is designed to map each parent
      invoice ID to a random date. The random date is generated by adding a
      random number of days (between 1 and 100) to the date when the
      organization associated with the invoice was created. The model uses a
      common table expression (CTE) to first identify the earliest created date
      for each parent invoice ID. This is achieved by joining the invoices table
      from the raw_source_data schema with the d_organizations table from the
      dwh schema on the organization_id column. The ROW_NUMBER() window function
      is used to rank the rows within each partition of parent_invoice_id,
      ordered by the created_date_ts. The first row (i.e., the one with the
      earliest created_date_ts) for each parent_invoice_id is selected. The
      final output of the model includes the parent_invoice_id and the generated
      random_date.
    columns:
      - name: PARENT_INVOICE_ID
        description: This column represents the unique identifier of the parent invoice.

          (between 1 and 100) to the creation date of the organization
          associated with the invoice. The creation date is obtained from the
          'created_date_ts' column in the 'd_organizations' table in the 'dwh'
          schema of the 'dcf_deel_test' database.
